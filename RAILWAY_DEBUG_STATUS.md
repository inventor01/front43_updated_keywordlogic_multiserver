# Railway Deployment Debug Status - Front 38

## Issue: Health Check Continues to Fail

The Railway deployment builds successfully but the health check at `/health` never responds, causing deployment failure.

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- All dependencies installed correctly
- Docker image created successfully
- Build time: 51.48 seconds

### Health Check Status: ❌ FAILING
- Path: `/health`
- Retry window: 2 minutes
- All attempts fail with "service unavailable"
- Server appears to not be binding to the port properly

### Debugging Steps Taken:

1. **Complex Flask Server** → Still failed
2. **Simple Flask Server** → Still failed  
3. **Minimal HTTP Server** → Testing now

### Possible Root Causes:

1. **Port Binding Issue**: Server may not be binding to Railway's assigned port
2. **Startup Crash**: Application may be crashing during startup
3. **Environment Variables**: Missing required environment variables
4. **Dependency Issues**: Some package may be causing startup failure

### Current Test:
Using Python's built-in HTTPServer instead of Flask to eliminate dependency issues.

### Next Steps if This Fails:
1. Add extensive logging to identify crash point
2. Check for missing environment variables
3. Create startup script that logs everything
4. Test with Railway's specific port configuration

### Token Monitor Status:
Current system (Front 36) is working perfectly:
- Detecting tokens: "Crime Coin", "Viral Bricks", "Butt Gary"
- Processing platforms: 🔵 Pump.fun, 🟠 LetsBonk, ⚪ Other
- Real-time monitoring active
